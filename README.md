Thank you to [Hilary Gridley](https://hils.substack.com/) for the idea, from [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-become-a-supermanager-with).  Much of the inspiration comes from her custom GPT, as well as the instructions use her template. 

Props to [@okld](https://github.com/okld/streamlit-quill) for writing streamlit_quill.  The library was a lifesaver in this project, for allowing rich text AND for converting it into HTML for which I could feed it to OpenAI.  The application would be significantly less useful had it not been for this library.
